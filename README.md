# xlf-sync

> **The definitive CLI tool for synchronizing Angular XLIFF (1.2 & 2.0) locale files.**

**`xlf-sync`** is a robust, production-ready utility designed to solve the persistent challenge of Angular i18n management: keeping your locale files (`messages.<locale>.xlf`) in perfect sync with your source file (`messages.xlf`), without data loss or corruption.

It is built to integrate seamlessly into professional workflows, supporting both local development and strict CI/CD pipelines.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Full Synchronization**: Automatically adds missing keys from `messages.xlf` to all your locale files.
- **🛡️ Data Safety**: Never overwrites existing translations. Your work is safe.
- **🧬 Multi-Version Support**: Seamlessly handles **XLIFF 1.2** and **2.0** in the same project. It auto-detects the version per file.
- **🧹 Auto-Sorting**: Reorders translations in locale files to match the source file's order, ensuring clean and readable diffs.
- **💀 Graveyard Mode**: Optionally moves obsolete keys to a separate "graveyard" file instead of deleting them, preserving historical work.
- **🤖 CI/CD Ready**: Dedicated `check` command with strict exit codes for your build pipelines.
- **✨ Pretty Printing**: Normalizes XML formatting across all files, eliminating "dirty" diffs from other tools.

## 📦 Installation

Install globally or as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install -D xlf-sync
```

Run via `npx` or add a script to your `package.json`:

```bash
npx xlf-sync --help
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. The `sync` Command

The core command to update your locale files. It reads the source file and updates all target locale files found by the glob pattern.

```bash
# Basic usage
npx xlf-sync sync \
  --source src/locale/messages.xlf \
  --locales "src/locale/messages.*.xlf"
```

#### Sync Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--source <path>` | `src/locale/messages.xlf` | Path to the source XLIFF file generated by `ng extract-i18n`. |
| `--locales <glob>` | `src/locale/messages.*.xlf` | Glob pattern to find your target locale files (e.g., `src/locale/*.xlf`). |
| `--new-target <mode>` | `todo` | **Strategy for new keys:**<br>• `todo`: Fills target with `TODO`.<br>• `empty`: Leaves target empty.<br>• `source`: Copies source text to target. |
| `--obsolete <mode>` | `mark` | **Strategy for removed source keys:**<br>• `mark`: Keeps key with `state="obsolete"` (or prefix).<br>• `delete`: Permanently removes the key.<br>• `graveyard`: Moves key to a separate file (see below). |
| `--graveyard-file <pattern>` | `src/locale/_obsolete.{locale}.xlf` | Pattern for the output "graveyard" file. Used only if `--obsolete graveyard`. `{locale}` is replaced dynamically. |
| `--fail-on-missing` | `false` | Exits with error (code 1) if any keys are missing translations. Useful if you want to enforce 100% translation coverage during sync. |
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Simulates the operation without writing changes to disk. |

---

### 2. The `check` Command

A read-only command designed for **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipelines. It verifies the state of your translations without modifying any files.

```bash
# Check if files are in sync
npx xlf-sync check --fail-on-missing
```

#### Check Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--source <path>` | `src/locale/messages.xlf` | Path to the source XLIFF file. |
| `--locales <glob>` | `src/locale/messages.*.xlf` | Glob pattern for target locale files. |
| `--verbose` | `false` | Lists exactly which keys are missing or obsolete for each locale. |
| `--fail-on-missing` | `false` | **CI Failure Condition**: Fail if any translation targets are missing or empty. |
| `--fail-on-obsolete` | `false` | **CI Failure Condition**: Fail if obsolete keys exist in locale files. |
| `--fail-on-added` | `false` | **CI Failure Condition**: Fail if new keys exist in source that haven't been synced to locales yet. |

## 📚 Advanced Workflows

### Keeping Files Clean (Graveyard Mode)

For large, long-lived projects, we recommend the **Graveyard Strategy**. Instead of cluttering your main files with obsolete keys or deleting them immediately (and losing work), this mode moves them to a separate file.

```bash
npx xlf-sync sync --obsolete graveyard
```

**Result:**
- `messages.fr.xlf`: Contains **only** active, valid translations.
- `_obsolete.fr.xlf`: Contains all retired keys. You can restore them later if needed.

### Standard CI/CD Pipeline

Add this step to your Pull Request validation workflow to ensure no developer merges broken translations:

```yaml
- name: Verify i18n Sync
  run: npx xlf-sync check --fail-on-missing --fail-on-added --verbose
```
